- Install `ShellCheck` in the CI environment so shell script linting runs instead of skipping.
- Ensure a firewall utility like `ufw` or `iptables` is installed on target servers to satisfy environment checks.
- Gradually address flake8 ignores by refactoring modules such as `src/fastapi_app/api.py` to meet standard style guidelines.
- Consider expanding port checks to include application-specific services once deployment requirements are finalized.
