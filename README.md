# Supa-Container: Production-Ready AIOps & Agentic RAG Platform

Supa-Container is a complete, production-grade platform for building, deploying, and operating advanced AI applications. It combines a sophisticated agentic backend (RAG + Knowledge Graph) with a full suite of production services, including a polished UI, workflow automation, and a comprehensive AIOps and observability stack.

This repository provides a one-click deployment script to set up the entire containerized environment on your server.

## Features

-   **Advanced AI Backend:**
    -   **Agentic Framework:** A custom Python backend using Pydantic AI that can reason and use tools.
    -   **Hybrid RAG:** Combines semantic vector search (via Supabase/pgvector) with a temporal **Knowledge Graph** (via Neo4j) for deep, contextual analysis.
    -   **Secure API:** A robust FastAPI backend with endpoints for ingestion, streaming chat, model management, and built-in rate limiting.
-   **Polished User Interface:**
    -   **ChatGPT-like Experience:** A Next.js frontend with a full chat interface, conversation history, and Markdown/code rendering.
    -   **Supabase Auth:** Secure user authentication (login, signup, etc.) managed by Supabase.
    -   **Agent Transparency:** The UI displays which tools the agent used to arrive at its answer.
-   **Production-Grade AIOps & Observability:**
    -   **Full-Stack Tracing:** OpenTelemetry provides distributed tracing from the frontend click to the database query.
    -   **LLM Observability (Langfuse):** Dedicated tracing for AI performance, quality, and cost analysis.
    -   **Log Aggregation (Loki):** Centralized logging for all services.
    -   **Real-Time Monitoring (Netdata - *coming soon*):** High-fidelity, real-time metrics.
    -   **Unified Dashboards (Grafana):** A single pane of glass for all metrics, logs, and traces.
    -   **Security Auditing:** A database-level audit log tracks all user actions.
    -   **Traffic Monitoring:** Traefik access logs are captured for security and performance analysis.
    -   **Self-Healing Feedback:** An AI orchestrator analyses logs, monitoring exports and database state to launch specialised agents for automatic remediation.
-   **Integrated Tooling:**
    -   **AI Prototyping Lab (Flowise):** A low-code UI for rapidly building and testing new AI flows.
    -   **Workflow Automation (n8n):** An integrated n8n instance for connecting your AI to other services.

## Deployment Walkthrough

Deploying this platform is now a simple, four-step process.

### Step 1: Configure Your Deployment

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cbwinslow/supa-container.git
    cd supa-container
    ```

2.  **Edit the Main Configuration File:**
    Open `config.sh` and set your domain, email, and a secure password for the Traefik dashboard.

### Step 2: Generate Secrets

Run the new `populate_secrets.sh` script. This will read your config and create a `.env` file with all the necessary secure, random passwords for your services.

```bash
bash populate_secrets.sh
```
*(This step does not require `sudo`)*

### Step 3: Deploy the Application

Run the main deployment script with `sudo`. This will create the server directories, copy the application code, and generate the final `docker-compose.yml`.

```bash
sudo bash deploy.sh
```

### Step 4: Final Setup & Key Retrieval

This is a one-time setup to initialize the database and get your unique Supabase API keys.

1.  **Start the Services:**
    ```bash
    cd /opt/supabase-super-stack
    sudo docker-compose up -d
    ```
    Wait a minute for all services to start.

2.  **Run the Post-Deployment Script:**
    This script will apply the database schemas and fetch your API keys.
    ```bash
    # From the /opt/supabase-super-stack directory
    sudo ../post-deploy-setup.sh
    ```

3.  **Update Your `.env` File:**
    The script will print your unique `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`. **Manually copy these lines and paste them into your `.env` file:**
    ```bash
    sudo nano /opt/supabase-super-stack/.env
    ```

4.  **Restart the Application:**
    For the new keys to take effect, restart the relevant services.
    ```bash
    sudo docker-compose restart nextjs_app fastapi_app
    ```

Your application is now fully deployed and operational!

## CI/CD via GitHub Actions

Automated deployments are provided by the `deploy.yml` workflow. The pipeline runs linting and tests, deploys the stack to a remote host over SSH using `deploy.sh` and Docker Compose, and verifies https://opendiscourse.net after the deployment. Configure `DEPLOY_HOST`, `DEPLOY_USER`, `DEPLOY_KEY`, and `DEPLOY_PATH` secrets to enable this workflow.

## TUI Service Menu

An experimental text-based interface is available for running common setup
tasks and launching optional service containers.

```bash
python scripts/service_menu.py
```

Use the arrow keys to navigate and press Enter to run the selected action.
