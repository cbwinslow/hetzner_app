- Added missing FastAPI imports and response/security helpers in `src/fastapi_app/api.py`.
- Initialized logger, rate limiter, and security middleware.
- Defined `/chat` and `/chat/stream` endpoints with proper function signatures.
- Wrapped the body of `generate_stream` in `try/except/finally` to emit SSE error events, close runs, and send terminating `end` events.
